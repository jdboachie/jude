A portfolio site isn't necessarily on the requirements section of the job ad - but it shows recruiters that you're serious about your work and you have work you are proud to present.

After years of programming, I've decided to make a portfolio site.
Problem is - I haven't built any portfolio projects.

pssst! Enjoy this nice image ðŸ‘‡

Portfolio sites are _everywhere_, man. Seems like everybody has one now. Everybody who wants to be somebody, at least.
Most people use it to show case their work. Others just blog on there. I wonder if a portfolio site is a requirement for getting a job these days.
Well, you definitely have to get a few projects under your sleeve. Then there's the question of how employers are going to notice you.

"Well, isn't there Linkedin as well? More people are likely to find you on Linkedin than on your portfolio site."
While it's true that recruiters are likely to look at your Linkedin profile... _oh what am I saying_

**Let's be real**

I've never actually been employed via linkedin or some other job site. (That's all about to change tho). I've only ever been hired over Whatsapp.
I need that to change.
It's part of my motivation for this site, really. To put myself out there properly; to be world-class.

I can do better with mdx.
