Creativity is communicated in our work. Our design, engineering and architectural choices are a representation of who we are and what we value.
Work we are satisfied with enough to present reveals the tings we deem beautiful and worth sharing.

It makes for good inspiration and taste development when you learn from others. I like to say _copy quickly and creatively_. Ofcourse, it is not a good idea
to imitate to the point of losing your originality and identity, but fundamentally, we stand on the shoulders of great people. We build on what others have done.
