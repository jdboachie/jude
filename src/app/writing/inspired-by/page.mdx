I'll start with a quote.

Creativity is communicated in our work. Our design, engineering and architectural choices are a representation of who we are and what we value.
Work we are satisfied with enough to present reveals the things we deem beautiful and worth sharing.
I've noticed, many times, how that people tend to copy others. A unique re-implementation _inspired by_ someone's work, rather than a direct reproduction.


An example is realizing that [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me)'s `/writing` page looks like it was inpired by [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com)'s blog:

<CompareImages
  images={
    [
      {src: '/rauchg-blog-list.png', alt: 'Guillermo Rauch\'s Blog'},
      {src: '/paco-blog-list.png', alt: 'Paco Coursey\'s Blog' },
    ]
  }
  darkModeImages={
    [
      {src: '/rauchg-blog-list-dark.png', alt: 'jag'},
      {src: '/paco-blog-list-dark.png', alt: 'jag' },
    ]
  }
/>

Interesting to note that Rauno Frieberg uses the same orange dot <div className="mx-1 inline-flex size-4 bg-orange-500 rounded-full" /> as Rasmus Andersson.


It makes for good inspiration and taste development when you learn from others. I like to say _copy quickly and creatively_. Ofcourse, it is not a good idea
to imitate to the point of losing your originality and identity, but fundamentally, we stand on the shoulders of great people. We build on what others have done.

I personally draw lots of inspiration from what I see. Study how people created their work. What makes it nice? What makes it work? How can I make it better?
On the other hand, there are those that advocate being completely original.

# Building my site
My personal site is heavily inspired by [paco.me](https://paco.me) and [rauno.me](https://rauno.me).

PS: I have felt very indecisive releasing this post. It constantly felt unfinished and unpolished. But I need to let go and move on to other things. Hope you enjoyed it!
