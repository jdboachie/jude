I'll start with a quote.

<Quote

Creativity is communicated in our work. Our design, engineering and architectural choices are a representation of who we are and what we value.
Work we are satisfied with enough to present reveals the things we deem beautiful and worth sharing.
I've noticed, many times, how that people tend to copy others. A unique re-implementation _inspired by_ someone's work, rather than a direct reproduction.
There are paradigms that are tried and tested and, hence, are a baseline in many works.
In an effort to narrow down the scope of this essay, I should state that I am mainly considering web design.
[Progressive enhancement](https://resilientwebdesign.com) would allow for a certain amount of copying or imitation to be done for baseline functionality.

{/* ### A few examples
[Paco Coursey](https://paco.me)'s `/writing` page definitely looks like it was inpired by [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com)'s blog:

<BlockQuote>should build a carousel for this</BlockQuote>

<CompareImages
  images={
    [
      {src: '/rauchg-blog-list.png', alt: 'Guillermo Rauch\'s Blog'},
      {src: '/paco-blog-list.png', alt: 'Paco Coursey\'s Blog' },
    ]
  }
  darkModeImages={
    [
      {src: '/rauchg-blog-list-dark.png', alt: 'jag'},
      {src: '/paco-blog-list-dark.png', alt: 'jag' },
    ]
  }
/>

Also interesting to note that Rauno Frieberg (and a few others I've seen) uses the same orange dot <span className="mx-1 inline-flex size-4 bg-orange-500 rounded-full" /> as Rasmus Andersson for branding, favicons, etc. */}

### <q>Innovation, not imitation</q>
On the other hand, there are those that advocate being _original_.

{/* <BlockQuote>To be fair, these cars look pretty slick</BlockQuote> */}

It makes for good inspiration and taste development when you learn from others. I like to say _copy quickly and creatively_. Ofcourse, it is not a good idea
to imitate to the point of losing your originality and identity, but fundamentally, we stand on the shoulders of great people. We build on what others have done.

I personally draw lots of inspiration from what I see. Study how people created their work. What makes it nice? What makes it work? How can I make it better?
As Emil said in a [related post](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/developing-taste),
<q>The things you'll create probably won't be good at first, but that's a good sign. Your taste is good enough to tell that your work is not on par yet. This phase is normal. Don't quit, it'll get better overtime.</q>


### Building my site

My personal site is heavily inspired by [paco.me](https://paco.me) and [rauno.me](https://rauno.me). I'm happy with what I've built for now. I'll redesign as I find new inspiration and keep learning.

PS: I have felt very indecisive releasing this post ;( . It constantly felt unpolished and unfinished. I trust my writing to get better with time. Hope you enjoyed it!
