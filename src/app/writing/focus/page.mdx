focus: becoming a master of one

### intro
do you have unfinished projects? skills you said you'd learn but never got round to? countless books you've bought and not read? Let's talk about focus.

I have realised that over the past two to three years, I've been hopping from one programming language to the other, one technology to another. More recently, I've been doing python development and web dev at the same time. I did a bit of Go programming and used it build a tiny command line tool. This year, I plan to focus üòê. I chose web development - product development, as Lee put it (link to his article on that). A lot of people do not focus, and so progress is spread across many different areas of interest.  I heard a story about Adolf Hitler in the WWII where he used to focus on one thing with his entire military force. But there was a time he split his army in two and they were fighting two battles at the same time. He ended up loosing both. ( I really could tell that story better lol ). In this little piece, I want to tell you why I think focusing on one thing is better than spreading your time across many things at one.

Think about the way pianist focus on learning the piano. It takes tons of practice to become a master. https://youtu.be/n6GEcdh5whk?si=cBVwWmzZj79tdmES It always fascinates me how they know where to place their finger for which key (meanwhile I'm typing at 100wpm on my keyboard at the moment). Let's talk about that a second - learning to type on the keyboard without looking. I practiced. A lot. For a long time, it was the only thing I was doing on the laptop. It really looked - and sounded - super cool when you were dancing across the keys. It took a lot of focus to get my accuracy up and then my speed after a while. Because I've spent time focusing on learning to type, I do it really well and without much effort.
I digressed. Let's talk about piano learners and focus. Oh do you remember the piano guys? They were amazing. Years of practice got them there.

The thing with learning how to code in my corner of the world is that we like to take every opportunity we get. That often means becoming a jack of all trades and master of none. That quote _does_ go on to say that jack is often better off - but is he, really?
This is for much later but think about this too: employability. Are you well versed in any one of these trades, Jack? I've learnt that companies don't hire you on the basis of how many programming languages you're fluent in - something I subconsciously held as true. Now, of course, I am not basing my argument on whether or not so and so a company would find you employable.You should be fluent enough in a language to actually produce business value to a company or client or build something. It will be good to remember that programming languages were created to facilitate the building of product. Product was always the center of programming ( just as user is at the centre of product). It will be beneficial to focus on that.

problems I've overcome:
one big problem I've had is not feeling good enough. truly, I wasn't good enough. In 2023, I got the chance to interview with Bloomberg for a software engineering intern role. I was not ready, neither good enough. I don't have much to show for the many programming languages I can code in - but I do have web dev projects because I have specialised there. The curious exploration of the programming world that most greenhorns have is totally valid. It's quite like our education system. Up till junior high, we take a lot of random courses. From senior high, we start to focus on a career path and narrow it down further in uni. The masters and phd levels are both higher levels of focus.

A thought about Archimedes: he is known to have said eureka when he found out how to measure volume by displacing water. He was in his bath tub, apparently, and noticed the water rise as he slipped in. He was focused. One thing occupied his mind. His eureka moment soon came.

Becoming a master of one often doesnt mean neglecting all else.
